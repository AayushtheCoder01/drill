/* ============================================================================
 * SettingsHome — a grouped rail, one page at a time, and a way to find a
 * control without knowing which page it is on.
 *
 * What was here before the settings rework was three tabs where the first held
 * fifteen unrelated controls in one column: the theme picker, then the accent
 * swatches, then the API key, then five switches, then the scheduler, then a
 * tutor prompt. Nothing grouped, nothing headed, no order anyone could name,
 * and a Save button at the bottom that applied to seven of the fields and not
 * to the other eight.
 *
 * Three things stay deliberate:
 *
 *   Conversation is the first page, not a bolted-on tab. Opened from a thread,
 *   the settings for *that thread* are the most local scope and belong at the
 *   front of the same rail — the three scopes are one inheritance chain
 *   (conversation beats project beats global), and showing them as one list is
 *   what makes that legible.
 *
 *   The rail is grouped and it does not scroll away. Nine flat names is a list
 *   you read; four headings with two or three names under each is a list you
 *   scan. Under 860px there is no room for a column beside the page, so the
 *   same list becomes the row of pills it used to be — one component, two
 *   shapes, no second navigation.
 *
 *   Search returns *settings*, not pages. Every page is one word you have to
 *   guess right, and the app has already lost a feature to that: backup and
 *   restore sat in the review loop's Menu while the person who needed it went
 *   looking under Settings. Typing "backup" now lands on the group that holds
 *   it, wherever it has ended up living, with it marked.
